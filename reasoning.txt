Let's break down the implementation of this Tic-Tac-Toe game by analyzing the provided code and matching it to the UI requirements. Below is the step-by-step reasoning behind the implementation.

Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. HTML Structure
Container: The main container (div.game) is used to center the game on the page. It has fixed dimensions (600x600px) and is positioned absolutely at the center using top: 50%, left: 50%, and negative margins.
Header Section:
A logo (a.neave) on the top-left links to https://neave.com/. It contains an SVG for the "N" logo and a disc for hover animation.
A mute/unmute button (div.mute) on the top-right uses an SVG speaker icon to toggle audio.
Game Grid:
A 3x3 grid (div.board) is created using floated div.square elements (each 33.333% width and height).
Each cell is clickable (via tabindex="0") and can display 'X' or 'O' inside a nested div. Classes like top, left, right, and bottom help style the grid lines.
A div.restart overlay covers the grid to handle restarts after a game ends.
Scoreboard:
A div.scores section below the grid displays scores for "PLAYER 1 (X)", "TIE", and "PLAYER 2 (O)" (or "COMPUTER" in 1P mode).
It includes a mode toggle button (div.swap) with a user icon (SVG) to switch between 1P and 2P modes. The labels "1P" and "2P" are shown accordingly.
Game State Overlay:
The div.restart overlay becomes visible (display: block) when the game ends, allowing the user to restart by clicking the grid.
2. CSS Styling
Font: Uses Raleway with a weight of 400, loaded via Google Fonts as specified.
Background: The body has a solid black background (#000), matching the UI.
Grid:
The 3x3 grid is created using floated div.square elements with percentage-based dimensions.
Grid lines are drawn using borders on the squares (e.g., border-bottom-style: solid for top squares). Borders are white (#fff) and 5px thick (adjusted for smaller screens).
Each cell has a hover effect (background changes to #333 on focus) and can display 'X' or 'O'.
Characters:
'X' is styled using pseudo-elements (:before and :after) to create two rotated lines forming a cross. Normal state is light gray (#999), and winning state is white (#fff).
'O' is a circle with a thick border, styled similarly for normal (#999) and winning (#fff) states.
The appearance animation (appear) uses a cubic-bezier timing function for a bouncy effect when 'X' or 'O' is placed.
Scoreboard:
Scores and labels are centered using text-align: center.
Labels and scores use white text (#fff), with Raleway font at 20px for labels and 50px for scores (adjusted for smaller screens).
Small 'X' and 'O' icons next to player labels are styled similarly to the grid characters but smaller.
Animations:
Blinking animation for a tie (border-blink) changes the grid border color, repeating three times over 0.3s.
Blinking animation for a win (blink) changes the opacity of winning cells, repeating three times.
The logo disc has a hover animation (neave-anim) and fade effect (fade-anim).
Icons:
SVGs are used for the logo, speaker, and user icons. They are white (#fff) and styled to match the UI's minimalistic design.
3. JavaScript Logic
Game State:
A 3x3 array (w) represents the board: 0 for empty, -1 for 'X', and 1 for 'O'.
Tracks the current player (L: true for 'X', false for 'O').
Scores (n for 1P mode, i for 2P mode) are maintained for Player 1, Tie, and Player 2.
Tracks game mode (q: false for 1P, true for 2P).
Game Flow:
On cell click (D function), the current player's symbol is placed if the cell is empty.
In 1P mode, the computer makes a move (C function) after the player's turn with a delay (h = 300ms).
Checks for a win or tie (x function) after each move.
Updates scores and triggers animations based on the outcome.
Allows restarting (I function) by clicking the grid after the game ends.
Win Condition:
Checks rows, columns, and diagonals (g array) for three matching symbols (sum of 3 for 'O', -3 for 'X').
Tie Condition:
If the board is full (9 moves) and there’s no winner, it’s a tie.
Computer Move (1P Mode):
Implements a simple AI (C function):
First checks for a winning move for itself.
Then blocks the player’s winning move if possible.
Otherwise, picks a random empty cell (with some probability to avoid the player's first move).
Animations:
CSS animations (blink and border-blink) handle blinking for win/tie states.
JavaScript triggers these by adding win or tie classes to the board or squares.
Audio:
Toggles mute/unmute state (T function) with a speaker button, using local storage to persist the setting.
Plays sound effects (y function) for moves and game outcomes (simulated here without actual audio).
4. Event Handling
Cell Clicks: Each square has ontouchstart and onmousedown events to call D and place 'X' or 'O'.
Mode Toggle: The scoreboard (div.scores) has a click event to toggle between 1P and 2P modes (M function), resetting the game.
Mute Button: The mute button has a click event to toggle the mute state (T function) and update the speaker icon.
Restart: The div.restart overlay has a click event to restart the game (I function) after a win or tie.
5. Implementation Details
Libraries: Uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as specified.
Assets: Inline SVGs are used for the logo, speaker, and user icons to match the UI.
Responsive Design:
Media queries adjust the layout for smaller screens (e.g., 960px, 540px, 350px).
Uses relative units (e.g., percentages, vw, vh) to ensure the game scales properly.
Adjusts font sizes, grid dimensions, and margins for different screen sizes.
Explanation of the Code
HTML:
Structured with a container (div.game), header (logo and mute button), 3x3 grid (div.board), and scoreboard (div.scores) with a mode toggle button.
Uses inline SVGs for icons to match the UI precisely.
CSS:
Uses floated elements with borders for the 3x3 grid layout.
Styles 'X' and 'O' with pseudo-elements and borders, matching the UI's shading for normal and winning states.
Implements blinking animations for win/tie states using CSS keyframes.
Ensures a black background, white lines, and gray/white symbols as per the UI.
JavaScript:
Manages game state (board, current player, scores, mode) using variables and functions.
Handles cell clicks, win/tie conditions, and computer moves in 1P mode.
Updates the UI with scores, turn indicators, and animations.
Implements mode toggle and mute functionality (simulated audio).
This implementation provides a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game that closely matches the provided UI and functionality, ensuring an engaging experience for your niece.
